<b>If you are interested in </b><br>
1. Using an already hosted gateway<br>
OR<br>
2. Having your own gateway hosted<br>
you can contact a downstream project <a href="http://scigap.org/" target="_blank">Science Gateways Platform as a Service (SciGaP)</a> and request your gateway. 
<br>SciGaP runs Apache Airavata as a platform service.
