- Airavata’s architecture is extensible to support for other underlying resources as well.
- Traditional scientific applications provide a portal for users to submit and manage scientific applications which is called as science gateways.
- Airavata can be used by scientific gateway developers as their middleware layer. They can directly call Airavata API in order to communicate with grid based system.
